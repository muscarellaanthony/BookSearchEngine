# Book Search Engine

## Description
This project was my first taste of a true full stack app and graphql. The skeleton was handed to us full functional but dependent on REST methods for front and back end communication. It was my job to remove the REST methods and implement graphql to the front and back end. This gave me a much better grasp for full stack functionality and flow and helped familiarize me with graphql.

## Usage
To use the app, navigate to its home screen and enter a book into the search bar. Click the submit search button and results for the selected book will appear on screen. [See example image here](./client/public/BookSearchEngine.png)
